CI/CD 
Build Pipeline

solution for continous agile development for getting build with least human intervention

20 modules --> build --> dev/test --> very hard to coordinate

Developer
requirement --> git checkout[new copy of code] --> make your changes --> in your local dev environment --> commit code --> jenkins[every 1 hour job runs] --> it takes all commit and respective from different module --> final build [2.3.4] --> be tested by testing team


Enviornment
dev --> laptop/shared server for dev activities
test --> used for testing by testing
UAT --> user acceptance testing/demo environment
PROD --> production

Devops team

Jenkins --> CI/CD
open source automation server 
building 
deploying and 
automating CI/CD build cycle
